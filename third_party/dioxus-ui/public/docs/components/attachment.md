<StaticAttachment class="bg-accent" />

## Installation

<StaticInstallAttachment />

## Usage

```rust
use crate::ui::attachment::{
    Attachment, AttachmentAction, AttachmentActions,
    AttachmentContent, AttachmentDescription, AttachmentGroup,
    AttachmentMedia, AttachmentTitle, AttachmentTrigger,
};
```

```rust
rsx! {
    Attachment {
        AttachmentMedia {
            FileText {}
        }
        AttachmentContent {
            AttachmentTitle { "sales-dashboard.pdf" }
            AttachmentDescription { "PDF · 2.4 MB" }
        }
        AttachmentActions {
            AttachmentAction { aria_label: "Remove sales-dashboard.pdf",
                X {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Composition

```
Attachment
├── AttachmentMedia        (icon or image)
├── AttachmentContent
│   ├── AttachmentTitle
│   └── AttachmentDescription
├── AttachmentActions
│   └── AttachmentAction   (ghost icon button, icon-xs by default)
└── AttachmentTrigger      (absolute overlay — href → <a>, onclick → <button>)
```

Wrap multiple attachments in `AttachmentGroup` for a horizontally scrollable snap row.

## Examples

### Image

Set `variant: AttachmentMediaVariant::Image` on `AttachmentMedia` and render an `img` inside it. Use `orientation: AttachmentOrientation::Vertical` to stack the media above the content.

<StaticAttachmentImage class="bg-accent" />

### States

Use the `state` prop on `Attachment` to reflect upload progress. Available states: `Idle`, `Uploading`, `Processing`, `Error`, `Done`.

<StaticAttachmentStates class="bg-accent" />

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to control padding and icon sizing. Available: `Default`, `Sm`, `Xs`.

<StaticAttachmentSizes class="bg-accent" />

### Group

Wrap attachments in `AttachmentGroup` to lay them out in a horizontally scrollable, snapping row.

<StaticAttachmentGroup class="bg-accent" />

### Trigger

Add `AttachmentTrigger` inside an `Attachment` to make the whole card clickable. Pass `href` to render as an `<a>`, or `onclick` for a button trigger. Actions inside `AttachmentActions` remain independently clickable above the trigger.

<StaticAttachmentTrigger class="bg-accent" />
